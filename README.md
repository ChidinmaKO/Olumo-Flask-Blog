#### Why Olumo?
This repo was named after [Olumo Rock](https://hotels.ng/guides/destinations/everything-need-know-olumo-rock/) located in the city of Abeokuta, Ogun State which is in South-Western [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria) ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬.Â The rock provided protection to the [Egba people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egba_people) during the inter-tribal warfare in the 19th century. Did you know that Olumo actually means "troubles and sufferings are all over"? Did you also know that it symbolizes unity and freedom not just for the [Egbas](https://kwekudee-tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com/2014/08/egba-people-yoruba-sub-tribe-of-freedom.html), who were the original inhabitors of [Abeokuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abeokuta), but for the entire people of Abeokuta?
The Olumo rock is a popular tourist attraction.
